Week/Sprint/Model 3 Challenge - JavaScript

## Description

This project is a mock-up password generator allowing the user to generate a passoword of randomly selected characters. 
This is an introductory project for JavaScript, in which the student needed to create conditions, variables, and formulas to generate the password. The methods I used, as this matierl is new to me, were based mainly off our work in the preceeding class on objects, arrays, math methods, window prompts, and conditional statements. 

## Installation

## Usage

This site allows a user to generate a password comprising a random selection of characters. The user determines the length of the password between a select range and confirms whehter to incldue special characters, numbers, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters. The password will not accept lengths that are not betwen 8-128 characters, and the password must include at least one set of special characters, numbers, uppercase letters, or lowercase letters. This is a student execise and is not intended to general secure passwords.
